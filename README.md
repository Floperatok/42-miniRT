## üìë Introduction
School 42's `miniRT` introduces students to the world of raytracing, 3D modeling and LOTS of maths. The goal of this project is to render 3D Computer-Generated-Images with basic shapes and lightning effects using the [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).\
This project features spheres, cylinders and planes as well as dynamic and ambient lighting, making a full phong reflection with some specular reflection.
## Usage
Download `miniRT` and enter the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Floperatok/42-miniRT.git && cd 42-miniRT
```
For linux users, you will need to install the following packages:
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
```
For Mac and Windows user you can refer to the unofficial [Minilibx doc](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html) and modify the Makefile.

Compile the project:
```sh
make
```
The project is now ready to be launched !
```sh
./miniRT your_map.rt
```
You can find some pre-built maps in the `maps` directory or create your own using the following rules :
- Each line represents an object.
- There must be one and only one camera.
- There can be at most one ambient lightning.
- Each lines must have all non-obtional arguments separated with spaces or tabs.

## Perfomances
It is well known that raytracing algorithms are really slow and computing heavy, and this project is no exception. With a big window, dozens of objects more than 20 light bounce, the rendering time can easily be counted in seconds. The problem stems mainly from the fact that school 42 requires all calculations to be performed on the processor and not on the graphics card... To overcome this problem, I added a way to use multithreading during the rendering process by dividing the screen into a grid and letting each thread work on one tile of the grid in parallel. This solution saves an enormous amount of rendering time, and allows each frame to be calculated quickly enough to produce a more or less fluid video on the simplest renders.
Enable multithreading :
```sh
./miniRT your_map.rt 1
```
Press `SpaceBar` to compute the next frame with a slight change in camera rotation. \
Disable multithreading :
```sh
./miniRT your_map.rt 0
```
